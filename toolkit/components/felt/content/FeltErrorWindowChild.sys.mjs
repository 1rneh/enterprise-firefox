/**
 * Error-capture dedicated window actor. It is expected to be only setup on
 * matching pages like about:neterror/about:certerror and is there to pass the
 * error page URI information back to the parent-side of this window actor for
 * further processing, including extracting the error code to later display it
 * properly.
 *
 * It relies on inspecting the docShell that contains several nsIChannel:
 *  - failedChannel: this channel is related to the **real** URL that was trying
 *    to be accessed, i.e. the page that when loading triggered the error.
 *
 *  - currentDocumentChannel: this channel is related to the **loaded** content,
 *    so it is exactly what is needed here, since it holds the about: error
 *    page's URL.
